### Features

*   ARVE is now SEO friendly. Letting you specify title, description, upload date to provide search engines with the schema.org data they like to have for better indexing.
*   <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> Editor. No more messing around with shortcodes and previewing.
*   New improved dialog for embedding videos.
*   Embeds via pasting the URL in its own line just like WordPress!
*   Magigally makes those url embedded videos responsive
*   No 'lock in' for the above' if you use providers WordPress already supports
*   Supports [almost every video hoster](https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/#video-host-support) that supports iframe embed codes.
*   Optionally use very powerful Shortcodes instead
*   One single button for all providers (for most providers not required because of URL embeds, but allows to create custom shortcodes with advanced features within seconds)
*   Responsive embeds with CSS, much better then with Javascript
*   Tries to be as unobtrusive as possible, sets 'hide brand' variables if supported, disabled related videos at the end … to help keep people on your site rather then going to YouTube or keep watching videos.
*   Clean shortcode syntax `[arve url="https://youtu.be/yUCFRL43Zm4"]`, no unnecessary shortcode wrapping.
*   Autostart (for providers that support it, mobile browsers prevent this)

		<h4>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; Finally something that works</h4>
		So I have a responsive theme but on pages with you tube videos it wasn't making the you tube videos fit in the mobile screen. I have spent the last hour trying many plugins and researching on google and finally I installed this. And I didn't have to update any settings or anything just refreshed a post with videos and all the sudden it is beautiful and responsive on my mobile phone!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!<br>

This plugin is financed by the awesome buyers of the [Pro Addon](https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/#purchase). The development and support of this plugins has become a almost full time job for me so I hope you understand that I can not make all features gratis and that you [purchase it](https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/#purchase) to get extra features support the develoment.

### [Pro Addon](https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/#purchase)

*   **Feel good about yourself**<br>
    for supporting my long time work on this plugin. Tons of hours, weekends … always worked on [improving it](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/changelog/) 4+ years.
*   **Disable links in embeds (killer feature!)**<br>
    For example: Clicking on a title in a YouTube embed will not open a new popup/tab/window. **Prevent video hosters to lead your visitors away from your site!** Note this also breaks sharing functionality and is not possible when the provider requires flash. Try it on [this page](https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/). Right click on links still works.
*   **Lazyload mode**<br>
    Make your site load **faster** by loading only a image instead of the entire video player on pageload.  
*   **Lazyload -> Lightbox**<br>
    Shows the Video in a Lightbox after clicking a preview image
*   **Link -> Lightbox**<br>
    Use simple links as triggers for lightboxed videos
*   Show the latest video of a YouTube channel by using the channel URL (updated/cached hourly)
*   Automatic or custom thumbnail images
*   Automatic or custom titles on top of your thumbnails
*   'Grow on click' feature
*   3 hover styles
*   2 play icon styles to choose from
*   Responsive thumbnails using cutting edge HTML5 technology

Addon makes ARVE ready for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). Requires the gratis plugins [ARVE](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/) and [AMP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/)

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### I have a problem ... ###

Please report it on [nextgenthemes.com/support/](https://nextgenthemes.com/support/) **and plaese not on the wordpess.org forums, thanks.**

### How to get the pro version working? ###

1. Go though the purchase process on [nextgenthemes.com/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/](https://nextgenthemes.com/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/)
1. Follow the 3 easy steps you get with the purchase receipt. It is basically downloading a arve-pro.zip and installing it through your WordPress Admin panel.

### Why are my videos not filling their container? ###

You are most likely use `align`, this plugin has a option for limiting video with with alignment. If you want your videos to fill their containers then you should not use the `align` shortcode attribute. This assumes that you left the 'Video Maximal Width' field on the options page empty (default + recommended)

### Can you add a video provider? ###

I have no plans on implementing providers that include videos via JavaScript such as www.nicovideo.jp. I also will not implement video services from mainstream media news organizations. For others, feel free to ask.

### How do I embed videos from a unlisted providers / iframes? ###

This plugin not changes anything to usual HTML `<iframe>` embed codes you have to use the shortcode creator dialog and paste iframe embed codes there or write them manually. They will become `[arve url="https://..."]`. The url represents what is the `src` in HTML embeds. It works as simple as this, if the [arve] shortcode does not detect a known URL structure then it will treat the URL as a `src` for the iframe.

### Why does my YouTube video not repeat/loop? ###

This plugins embed is considered as 'custom player' by YouTube so you have to pass the video ID as playlist parameters to make the loop work.

`[arve url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvRqvX413Ik" parameters="loop=1&playlist=pvRqvX413Ik"]`

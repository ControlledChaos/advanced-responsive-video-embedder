## Todo List ##

I would be glad if someone could [help me](https://github.com/nextgenthemes/advanced-responsive-video-embedder) with this, I can send you cash for helping out.

These are not in any real priority order (for now)

- [ ] Get advice how I could improve my sales of this the Pro Addon
- [ ] Advertise the Pro Addon somewhere
- [ ] Make the [Plugin Page](https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/) and the selling process UX more professional look and feel.
- [ ] Code review (and improvements)
- [ ] Extensive testing
- [ ] Write a special thanks page to [Howard Iken](http://www.myfloridalaw.com/)
- [ ] Improve [Documentation][50] - wording, grammar
- [ ] Improve [Documentation][50] - extend
- [ ] Improve [Documentation][50] - simplify
- [ ] Improve [Documentation][50] - write how to use kaltura, and other not directly supported providers with iframe
- [ ] Create a Feature Table?
- [ ] Comparison with other Plugins (Table?)
- [ ] Write docs about how to use iframe for not supported providers.
- [ ] Support for self hosting videos (or at least make them responsive as they are), consider making the WordPress videos responsive (maybe it just take a wrapper).
- [ ] How to manage beta versions with WordPress.org and the EDD Software licensing plugin (for the Pro Version)
- [ ] WordPress Language Pack thing (anything needed to do?)
- [ ] Pro Addon: Fix bug when sometimes the URL of iframe starts with "#lity" and fails use [arve_tests] Shortcode and look at the IGN example, the lazyload-lightbox fails.
- [ ] [Fix bug](https://community.nextgenthemes.com/90/i-put-in-youtube-url-and-get-the-no-provider-selected-message?show=90#q90) where youtube.be/xxxxx URLs are not detected by the shortcode creator. This may have something to do how PHP regexes are carried over do JS.
- [ ] Get rid of globals in PHP Code
- [ ] Consider writing JS create URL querys for embed customization (for use in shortcode creator dialog but also easy to use independant)

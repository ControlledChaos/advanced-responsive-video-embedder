<p>So I have a responsive theme but on pages with you tube videos it wasn&#39;t making the you tube videos fit in the mobile screen. I have spent the last hour trying many plugins and researching on google and finally I installed this. And I didn&#39;t have to update any settings or anything just refreshed a post with videos and all the sudden it is beautiful and responsive on my mobile phone!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!! <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/reviews/?filter=5">review by happyecho</a></p>

<p>I used a lot of high ranking plug-ins but they still broke my design. Downloaded this and worked right away. Thanks! <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/reviews/?filter=5">review by crconnell89</a></p>

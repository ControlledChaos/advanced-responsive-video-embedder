## Upgrade Notice ##

**Possible fix if you get a white screen of death after installing or updating to version 7:**
Please check your PHP logs for messages like this: `PHP Fatal error: Cannot redeclare tgmpa_load_bulk_installer() (previously declared in .../wp-content/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/includes/class-tgm-plugin-activation.php:3154) in .../wp-content/themes/humbleshop/inc/class-tgm-plugin-activation.php on line 1694` or as errors like this are caused by your theme or another plugin using a very old version of the TGMPA class that is trying to declare the class without checking if is already declared. You can replace the `class-tgm-plugin-activation.php` of your theme or another plugin with the [latest version](https://github.com/TGMPA/TGM-Plugin-Activation/releases) (you need only this single file from the zip) to get rid of this error. You should however contact the author of a conflicting theme/plugin and ask them to make a update and include a up-to-date version of TGMPA so they play nicely with other users of that php class. Sorry about this but this is not my fault.

If this is not the problem and you have a white sceen of death please delete the plugin from your plugins folder with SFTP/SSH or your hosts file browser and reinstall the [old version 6.5.0](https://nextgenthemes.com/arve-version-6.5.0.zip)

	<li><strong>Disable links in embeds (in beta)</strong><br>
		For example: Click on a title in a YouTube embed will not open a new popup/tab/window. <strong>Prevent video hosters to lead your visitors away from your site!</strong> Note this also breaks sharing functionality and is not possible when the provider requires flash. Try it on this page. Right click on links still works.</li>

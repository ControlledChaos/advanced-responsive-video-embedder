<p class="lead">The best WordPress plugin for videos? Supports close to everything you can imagine, still keeping it easy &amp; simple.</p>

<p>It is very likely the one and only plugin you will ever need to handle video embeds on your WordPress site(s).</p>

<p>Simple • Lightweight • Responsive • Customizable</p>

<p class="lead">Thanks to everyone who bought the <a href="https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/#purchase">Pro Addon</a></p>

<p>I really appreciate this. I commercialized parts of this plugin because I no longer can work on this for free and donations were not really doing it. I am glad not everyone thinks, everything needs to be gratis on the Internet, especially in Open Source. The Pro Addon, like the base version here, is still Free Software - free as in Freedom! not as in gratis. Well, actually I have given 712 licenses out free of charge to legacy users. I am thinking of stopping the giveaways.</p>

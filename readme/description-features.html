<h3>Features</h3>
<ul class="list-checked">
	<li>Embeds via pasting the URL in its own line just like WordPress!</li>

	<li>Optionally use Shortcodes instead</li>
	<li>One single button for all providers (for most providers not required because of URL embeds, but allows to create custom shortcodes with advanced features within seconds)</li>
	<li>Responsive embeds with CSS, much better then with JS IMO</li>
	<li>Tries to be as unobtrusive as possible, sets ‘hide brand’ variables if supported, disabled related videos at the end … to help keep people on your Site rather then going to YouTube or keep watching videos</li>
	<li>Clean Shortcode syntax <code>[vimeo id="123456"]</code> no ugly URLs, no unnecessary shortcode wrapping.</li>
	<li>Autostart (for providers that support them)</li>
	<li>Custom URL Parameters to use all options providers offer</li>
	<li>Optional maximal width</li>
	<li>Video alignment</li>
	<li>General iframe support for any provider that not included that support responsive iframe embeds or any URL you with to display in a iframe.</li>
	<li>Detailed description of options in-place.</li>
	<li>Custom Aspect Ratio</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Features with the Pro Addon</h3>
<ul class="list-checked">
	<li>Feel good about yourself for helping me support my long time work on this plugin. Tons of hours, weekends … always worked on <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/changelog/">improving</a> 3+ years.</li>
	<li>Lazyload mode: Only loads a preview image on pageload instead of the Video players itself. This makes your site load faster, especially with multiple videos in the same page.</li>
	<li>lazyload -&gt; Lightbox Shows the Video in a Lightbox after clicking a preview image.</li>
	<li>Lazyload -&gt; HTML5 Fullscreen: (experimental) This is a dream come true for me. Be aware that this has a issue of going fullsceen a 2nd time from within fullscreen and fullscreen Buttons not working as expected.</li>
	<li>Lazyload -&gt; Half Screen Sticky: (experimental) Video that fills about half the screen/window and lets users continue to scroll and read the site, start writing a comment … while watching a video. This relies on modern HTML5 features (calc, vw + vh) and may not work everywhere.</li>
	<li>Link -&gt; Lightbox: Use links as triggers for lightboxed videos.</li>
</ul>

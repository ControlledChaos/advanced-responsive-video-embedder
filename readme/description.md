## Description ##

This readme represents the upcoming version 6.0 and the Pro Addon, when it will be release only the normal mode (still responsive, very configurable ...) will be part of the free version here. If you not like this change, old versions will be aviable on Github. On top of this I give out free Pro Addons for people who installed this plugin before this announcement. I am afraid there will be still people hating, maybe more details on that later.

Many many thanks to everyone who donated or baught the Pro Addon already even if they could get it for free.
